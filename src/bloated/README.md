# Extra junk

This folder doesn't correspond to a release tier, but contains unnecessary, sometimes low-quality libraries that mirror ones many games end up wanting eventually. You likely have a preferred version of these libraries as is.

After improving these libraries, in the future this may correspond to a "bloated" release which contains utilities that are not dependencies of LM functionality.
